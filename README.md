# GérerTales · Editorial Studio 🐺

> Turn sparks into masterpieces with architectural precision.

GérerTales is a high-end editorial studio where human creativity meets neural intelligence. Designed for visionary storytellers, the platform moves beyond simple chat-based AI to provide a structured, architectural approach to world-building and narrative design.

## 🏛️ The Methodology

GérerTales is built on the philosophy that great stories require solid foundations. Our workflow follows a rigorous three-stage process:

1.  **The Spark**: Neural analysis of your initial concept to determine optimal structure, tone, and literary format.
2.  **The Blueprint**: Collaborative architecture of the *Dramatis Personae* (characters), *World Atlas* (locations), and a complete Narrative Arc before a single line of prose is written.
3.  **The Prose**: Drafting in a distraction-free environment with high-end typography and real-time AI expansion for descriptive depth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite (Modern, high-performance SPA)
- **Neural Infrastructure**: xAI (Grok-2/beta) for primary architecture and prose.
- **Visual Engine**: xAI Grok-Imagine for high-fidelity cover and banner generation.
- **Persistence**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime Auth)
- **Narration**: ElevenLabs Premium TTS + Native Web Speech integration.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom "Nordic Dark" editorial theme.
- **Testing**: Vitest suite for logic, ownership integrity, and state stability.
